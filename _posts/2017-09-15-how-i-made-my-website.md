People keep asking me about my website and how I built it. In this blogpost I’ll explain my motivation and inspirations that pushed me to work on it and the technologies, libraries and templates I used. Towards the end of my internship I thought to myself I ought to do something to make my presence known in the job market, what better way to do this than to make a personal website to showcase my skills and experience. 

I wanted to work on a template but not using sites like Wordpress as I wanted to learn web development languages along the process and have more control over the user interface and design. Hence, I started searching online for a free of cost, quick and less painful way to create, learn and publish a website with a unique look. Then I came across Jekyll, an open-source static site generator written in Ruby, really fun to use and simple to understand. It makes use of Handlebar like technologies to compile page templates and files together and render them together into a static set of content ready to be deployed on a server. I started working with [this](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) basic template (which was completely responsive across all platforms right out of the box) and slowly added my own modifications. Getting my modifications to also be responsive was challenging at first but after multiple tries I managed to get everything aligned and centered.

For the logo design, I took inspiration from the manga, One Piece. The logo for the pirate prison called ‘Impel Down’ is nothing but a [circle cropped version of the first letters from the two words stacked on top of each other](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/f/f6/Impel_Down_Logo.png/revision/latest?cb=20130726071605/). After a few minutes of browsing through and watching YouTube tutorial videos I went on to Photoshop to achieve the same effect for my logo which contains the letters ‘S’ and ‘P’.

Finally, I used github pages to host my site, it’s free of cost to use. All I paid for was the domain name using Namecheap. Overall, by undertaking this development expedition I got a good hands on experience with web development technologies especially SVG, Photoshop, Git and JavaScript.
